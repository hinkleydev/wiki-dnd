# Session 85 - Terms and conditions apply - 27/03/2025
## TL;DR
The party celebrate after defeating Velko. But the celebrations don't last long as the party prepare for their day in court. April meets Hermes, she strikes a deal with him for some cash, but doesn't listen carefully enough...

## Full notes
- April awakes, she’s in a circular stone room, many feet high
- She looks around. There’s no exit
- A giant gold coin falls from the ceiling, April narrowly dodges it
- When she looks at the coin, it has her face embossed on it
- She shouts into the void, asking who’s there
- She hears a chuckle, and the sounds of a purse jingling
- She wakes up in Lumpy Jack’s Inn along with everyone else
- Everyone goes down to breakfast
- Coby catches Ana up on everything that’s happened
- Coby introduces Ana to April
- We head to the library, Coby asks where the law books are
- Burzum also seeks out information on law
- April tries to get more information on Nasharr and the gods, but she gets overwhelmed and doesn’t learn much
- Something appears in the corner of Ana’s eye, she doesn’t notice, she’s too engrossed in the book
- Burzum studies the ring he got

> ### Promise Ring
> This ring is forged from black iron with spikes pointing inwards, gouging the finger.
> 
> When you first attune to this ring, you can touch one willing creature and form a magical bond between the two of you. While this bond lasts, whenever you are subjected to a spell or magical effect that restores hit points, the bonded creature also receives the benefits of the spell or effect.
>
> You cannot bond with another creature so long as you both live.
> 
> A creature can benefit from only one ring of amity's bond at a time.
>
> **Invoking the Rune.** When the bonded creature hits a target with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the ring's rune if you are within 60 feet of the bonded creature. The bonded creature's attack is then turned into a critical hit.
>  
> Once the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.

- Burzum attempts to cast bless on the ring
- Burzum seeks out a jeweller, he finds one, an elven man
- Burzum makes a deal with the jeweller to make him a holy symbol for 80GP, he hands over 40GP to begin the work
- Coby sees a bunch of people on Verisil with torches, their heads are bowed, they walk slowly. Two people lead the procession, they wear grey robes
- Everyone returns to Lumpy Jack’s, we debrief and go to sleep
- April wakes up in the same chamber, the coin is still on the floor
- Another coin falls, April doesn’t dodge it, it crushes her foot, she cries out
- Another one falls, crushing her leg
- More continue to fall, the chamber fills up with coins, burying her
- Everyone wakes up in Lumpy Jack’s
- The same day plays out, Coby studies law, April goes to study religion in the temples
- Burzum checks in on Lumpy Jack, asking if he can be of any use
- Burzum gets hired, he has to clean the same glass for eight hours straight
- April enters the trinit temple, sanit hall, a modern trinit temple, two towers stretch into the sky
- April looks around, finding a small Sunday school
- She finds a few books on the trinit, she reads a general one

>Trinit:
>1. The Scribe
>2. The Ancient Deity
>3. The Mad God, Aesys
>
>The Scribe brings creation and light - good - to the world.
>The Mad God brings destruction and dark - bad - to the world.
>The Ancient Deity acts as a scale, ensuring that the two forces remain in balance. 
>
>The Scribe and The Mad God sometimes look like you or I: it can be very important, therefore, to treat everyone with respect, lest they turn out to be a God.
