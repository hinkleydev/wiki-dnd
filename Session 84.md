## TL;DR
The beginning and end of Velko

## Full notes
- We settle down for a long rest
- Burzum is back in the room
- Everyone watches, April, Hope, Coby, and then Burzum
- April unattunes from the door knocker and attunes to the javelin of lightening
- April hears something wet from the middle distance, she keeps her flametounge close and her eyes peeled, but nothing happens
- Hope’s shift begins. She sees a large figure, she needs a source of light, she uses her flail, she can see something red and tall in the doorway
- The figure claims it means no harm, Hope wakes Coby up
- Coby looks at the figure, it seems to be walking around the perimeter of the room, it stops when it sees Coby
- Coby cast produce flame, holding it as a warning
- The creature insists it means no harm, and signals it wants home, pointing to a corridor we want to exit through
- Coby is trying to communicate with the creature, there’s a language barrier
- Coby understands it’s trying to pass without entering combat, but he’s reluctant to let them pass for the damage they’ll bring into the world
- Hope asks for a name, they tell us they’re Mo
- Hope asks if Mo has a family, it says no
- Hope and Coby debate killing it, Mo is visibly upset and pleading
- Coby gives Mo a choice, go back or die
- Coby tells Mo it has 20 seconds to leave or die, it pleads
- It attempts to leave to ‘home’, Coby strikes it down
- As the creature dies, it’s mouth agape, it repeats the words that Hope said to Coby, ‘let it live’
- Coby’s shift begins, it’s uneventful
- Burzum’s shift… begins? He can feel the ground moving, crickets chirping. He’s in a cart, moonlight flowing in through a slit in the wall. He notices his hands are unbound, he tries to leave, but feels a hand on his shoulder, she tells him we’re nearly there. Burzum asks to be reminded where they’re going, she tells him it’s Rin Metsam. She’s concerned that he doesn’t seem to be 100% present. She tells him there was a skirmish, Furnace Knights, Eoghan, attacked the goldtrees, and the cart is on route to help clean up and help with the burial
- As Burzum is processing everything going on, someone calls from the front of the cart to let them know they’re here. He can hear screams, calls requesting aid, people pleading for death, the smell is horrific
- As Burzum attempts to leave, she wraps her hands around him, asking him if he still has it, he tells her he does, as she pulls her hand away, it’s like charcoal, it is charcoal, she begins to crumble
- She asks him if he still believes it, he assures her he does
- He’s struck by the smell, it drags his head back by his nostrils, everything fades to black
. . . . .
- He awakes on a cold stone floor, his hands are bound, his eyes are swollen shut, a knight stands before him
- The knight declares Burzum is no innocent, and should have the sins he committed brought against himself
- The knight demands to know where she, Lilith, is
- Burzum tries to remember, he remembers handling the dead, separating corpses, dedicating himself endlessly to a goddess
- Burzum tells him, she’s everywhere, in a manner of speaking. The knight tightens a fist, his gauntlet glowing molten orange. Burzum does not remember the first blow
. . . . .
- Burzum awakes, he’s standing in a courtyard
- He’s surrounded by soldiers, excitedly whispering to one another, many people in the courtyard are looking at him
- He’s dressed as one of the soldiers, bastard sword in hand
- He understand he seems to be on some kind of raised platform, with someone giving a speech, a teenager
- The speech tells the people that even lumberjacks that water the trees intend to down them
- Three hooded individuals are brought onto the platform, two are kicked to their knees, the other one’s hood is removed. It’s the woman Burzum saw, Lilith. She gazes on the crowd with revulsion. She’s kicked to her knees, the executioner takes her place
- The speaker gives a final word, the executioner raises her axe, Burzum must make a decision
- Burzum takes sacred flame, aiming it at the executioner, he shouts as he strikes
- The executioner bursts into flames, Lilith takes her chance, breaking her restrictions and freeing the others
- Burzum runs to Lilith as the soldiers chase him down
- Burzum is pulled down by the crowds, blacking out as the first rib snaps
. . . . .
- He awakes, restrained. Lilith is restrained, a knife to her throat
- An ecstatic rouge is mocking Burzum, demanding to know where ‘it’ is
- Burzum mocks him, the rouge is threatening to kill both of them with a slow and painful death
- Lilith it pleasing with Burzum not to hand it, her heart, over
- Burzum unzips his pants, mockingly
- A tear falls from Lilith’s eye, the knife slides across her throat, blood pours to the floor
. . . . .
- Burzum awakes in a cold stone room, he’s laying down, oddly calm. What’s there to believe in? Why go on? Who should you be?
- Burzum notices a sharp pain in his finger, his reaction is slow
. . . . .
- Coby goes to wake up Burzum, and finds him wide awake already
- As Burzum gets up, Coby notices a small patch of blood of where he’s been sleeping
- Coby asks Burzum if he’s ok, and if he needs bandages
- Burzum puts his hand on Coby’s shoulder, assuring him he’s fine, but when Burzum removes his hand, some blood is on Coby’s shoulder
- Coby is alarmed, looking closely at Burzum’s hand, where he notices the bleeding seems to be coming from a ring Burzum is wearing
- Coby is questioning where this ring came from, Burzum says his wife, but he’s not sure if he ever got married
- Coby tries to cure the bleeding using healing word, it doesn’t work
- They all awake, they share a meal of rations and goodberries
- April tells Burzum he should stick by her, as the flametounge will help him see
- We strategise, fighters up front, others provide support
- Potions and healing resources are divided among the party
- We proceed through the corridor, it’s humid, we’re already sweating
