# Lordship
## Cobys Entry
Lordship is the power the Lords have claimed during the singularity. It allows them to live outside the scope of gods and other beings of power. 
I don't know how they got it, presumably from defeating a dragonlord... but the dragon's death is not necessary, as was the case with the Tyrant Maria. 
Her Lordship came in the form of a ring that i gave to Cille to end some of her suffering, though a ring may not be the case for the other holders. 

## Meta knowledge
Lordship is a power or Ability that was originally held by [[Dragon Lords]], but after the Singularity, some of the fighters of the rebellion gained lordship, Specificaly, Maria, Lenahn, Emon and Nash'gsteuf. it is not known how they were able to size the lordship, as the death of a dragon lord is not needed to clain their lordship.


### effects
The main power of is its ability to allow one to live outside the will and influence of the gods, stopping or blocking them from directly harming or impeding them. 
those with lordship dont need to eat or drink, but can if they wish to.
