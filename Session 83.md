# Session 83 - This is where a deal with Nashar gets me - 08/02/2025
## TL;DR
We solve the puzzle in the church like room. Upon leaving, we are set upon by an abomination of rot and several footsoldiers. As we proceed, we encounter more rot, he calls himself Velko, he claims he can't die, cause he'll be revived by his god whenever he dies, we kill the rot. As we move on, we engage in battle with a rot infected giant.

Rot-Binding Stones were developed in order to contain the Rot when it first showed itself.

They are made from the highly-rare red diamonds, which form around a single cell of Rot. The Rot, as is its wont, seeks to bind to all things - reinforcing itself above all else. However, when it comes across this trapped cell, though, it becomes confused: it will try forever to bind with the cell, without success, for it cannot penetrate the red diamond casing.

It appears that this particular Binding Stone was used by the enemy to keep a mass of rot together, forming the Phalanx.

The art of such things is long lost, though there is yet hope for a name is inscribed in the rim of the diamond: Vilhund of the Old Bay. Who is this Vilhund, and does he yet persist? Perhaps there something more to learn, then. 

As an action, one can throw this Binding Stone. It will attract all Rot and Rotblighted creatures in a 60 ft. radius to its location, where they will try - in vain - to penetrate it.

When taking damage, they may attempt a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, they may break their focus on the Stone for long enough to dispose of any hostile creatures in their surroundings. They will be immune to the effects of the Stone for 24 hours, or until the next dawn, at which point they must re-attempt the saving throw.
