The Drakebloods are a group of knights, the Highest order that serve under the Dragon lords. They served almost as their regents back when the dragonlords where still alive.

\* Sir Fer of the drakebloods may have been an illusion / a fake version of the real Sir fer, as he appeared in the dreamscape, and was very very weak for a drake blood.

It is possiable that when the Dragons where still around, they refered to themselves as their name, and the monicer of their Dragonlord, however they may now refer to themselves as Drakebloods, such as Sir Fer. [1]
